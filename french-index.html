        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>French is very cool innit, So I have been learning french for like a week now, Lol
            So I did what anyone does in this position, Yeah that'S right, I started making this course.
            That may sound ridiculous but hear me out Fam,
            You see, Best way to learn is to just tell someone else, and I have a very specific way of learning,
            SO! instead of finding a course which suits my needs best, What if I just take a pre-existing course
            and translate it into a course that is tailored for me, Future me.
